# known issues and limitations

1. freezing jumping issue on safari and firefox (possibily a problem with setInterval)
2. limited graphical alert method, would add sound and animation with more time
3. bell alert icons seem to flicker on the hour (needs further investigation)
4. not responsible to screen size /device
